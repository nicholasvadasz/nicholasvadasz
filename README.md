### Hi! âœŒâš¡ðŸŽ¶
Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Nicholas Vadasz and I am currently a junior at Brown University studying Computer Science. My interest lies in full-stack development, decentralized systems, and software engineering. Besides that, I love playing/listening to music, analog photography, and playing chess.
