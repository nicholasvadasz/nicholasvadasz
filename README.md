### Hi! âœŒâš¡ðŸŽ¶
Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Nicholas Vadasz and I studied computer science at Brown University. My interest lies in computer graphics, full-stack software development, and decentralized systems. Besides that, I love playing/listening to music, analog photography, and playing chess.
